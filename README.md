# Keeptabs
    "Keep tabs on your tabs!" - Jemmin Chang

* **Navigate your tabs using hotkeys** (quicker than you ever could with
your mouse!)
* **Stop making tabs of websites that you already have open** (you don't need 7
        facebook tabs open!)
* **Stop searching through the haystack of tabs** (especially when they're too thin
        to even show a logo!)

## Need to...

### Switch to your usual websites? Press the hotkeys that you set!
