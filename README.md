# Keeptabs
    "Keep tabs on your tabs!" - Jemmin Chang

* **Navigate your tabs using hotkeys** (quicker than you ever could with
your mouse!)
* **Stop making tabs of websites that you already have open** (you don't need 7
        facebook tabs open!)
* **Stop searching through the haystack of tabs** (especially when they're too thin
        to even show a logo!)

## Need to...

### Switch to your usual websites? Press the hotkeys that you set!

<br />
<br />
<br />

### Go back to your previous tab? Use Spacebar as your hotkey!

### Make a new tab of an open website? Add shift to your hotkey!
